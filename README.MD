# Money Divider App
## Description
The key functionality of this Android App is to take input prices from two different users and then display the amount one needs to pay the other such that both pays an equal amount in the end.

## Concept used

 This application is build with the help of View Model, Live Data, and Data Binding class. Whenever there is a configuration change occurs, such as screen rotation, activity is re-created, thus resulting text views to dismiss data and re-create it.
 This could be avoided with ViewModel. The data persists in the view model scope and it won't gets re-created on a configuration change. The code is made to follow clean code architecture.

## Final Product

* Note that:- The Edit Text were able to return the value as they were set with the same ID, thus it could automatically save an instance of the state while configuration change.
